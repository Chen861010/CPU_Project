# ZhenCPU Verification Environment

A SystemVerilog-based verification environment for the ZhenCPU, including FSM, ALU, register, memory testing, waveform analysis, and functional coverage.

##  Overview
ZhenCPU is a simplified CPU designed for instruction-level execution and hardware verification learning.  
This repository contains:

- RTL source code (SystemVerilog)
- Self-checking testbenches
- Waveform analysis
- Functional coverage reports
- Instruction program testing

##  CPU Modules
- **ALU** – arithmetic & logic operations  
- **MUX Units**  
- **Register File**  
- **Controller** – FSM-based instruction control  
- **Memory** – 8-bit data, 5-bit address  
- **Program Counter**

##  Verification Features
✔ Module-level testbenches  
✔ CPU integration testing  
✔ Directed + randomized stimulus  
✔ Waveform tracing (VCD/FSDB)  
✔ Functional coverage (FSM, opcodes, ALU paths)  
✔ Simulation logs for debugging
